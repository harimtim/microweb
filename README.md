# microweb
microweb is a simple module for MicroPython designed to easily set up a web server.


## Installation
Install the microweb.py file and drag it into your MicroPython Storage.\
Head over to [microweb.py](https://github.com/harimtim/microweb/blob/main/microweb.py) and download the file.

If you dont manuelly set up a html.html file you'll see the precoded html page, so better set up one by yourself!

import microweb
microweb.start_webserver()

>>> Connected!
>>> IP: 192.123.122.1
>>> Listining on: http://192.123.122.1
